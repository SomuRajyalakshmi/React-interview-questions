What is reactJS?

1. React JS is a 'javascript user interface library' for building web and mobile applications.
2 .React JS can be used to develop single page web applications.
React allows us to create reusable UI components.
3 .it uses virtual DOM for Updating the DOM Changes.
4 .Itâ€™s a library. Framework means everything should be with a single tool without taking of other tools like
routing, services, api calls, components creation. Everything works with commands easily. But in terms
of library, we need to download third party tools separately like routing (react-router-dom), 
api calls(axios) etc., So, this is the reason why react is called a library.
5. React won't render the output directly in the browser dom, 
  it will take the lightweight dom as backup which also known as Virtual DOM and
  compares with the state using diff algorithm,
  If there are any changes need to be updated in the browser DOM then 
  it will update Otherwise it won't do any updating to the browser dom.
